This project was originally intended for a Xbox 360 Controller for LocoXtreme. However, this will work with any Xbox controller. Regardless of it being wired/wireless.
---------------------------------
Prerequisites:
1. You need to have Chrome overrides enabled with the LocoXtreme webpage saved.
2. Next, you want to go to the sources tab in the inspect element panel and locate the skulpt folder
3. Inside of the skulpt folder you will find a file named "skulpt-stdlib.js"
4. Right click on the file and click on "Save for overrides"
5. Next, you want to find the file in your overrides folder and replace the entire thing with the modified version.
--------------------------------
TO USE:

1. Open up a new LocoXtreme Python program
2. Navigate back to the GitHub repository and copy the locorobocode.py code from any one of the modes you select.
3. Open up inspect element and go to the console tab and paste in the Controller code from one of the modes folder. If you did it right the console should print out "undefined".
4. Now you want to connect your xbox controller to your computer. After this, press any button for the browser to recognize the controller.
5. Now click run and you are all done!



That is all :)
