# School Assignments

This repository contains all of my programming assignments in my time at the Beaverton Academy of Science and Engineering. This repository's purpose is two-fold. First it gives me an opportunity to keep all of my programs under source control, this means that I can use this repo as a future reference. Secondly, it gives me a perspective of how my skills have progressed over the years.

Course 1: Programming & Robotics
----------------------------------------
Course Description: 

In Programming and Robotics we will explore the world of robotics and programming. We will be learning and using python to program a physical robot.  This is a project-oriented, hands-on course that encourages students to have fun while learning fundamental computer science concepts. The curriculum for this course was developed by LocoRobo.  They provide many written and video tutorials to guide you through the concepts. Freeing you up to use the LocoRobo videos and tutorial documents as an additional source of information.
